== Showroom

Showroom is an Ansible role that installs and configures Showroom, a replacement for bookbag.
Showroom provides views (1 or more webpages) onto external web-based resources (e.g. websites, webapps, etc.).
Its primary use case is to provide a one-stop console for demos, workshops, and labs.

=== Core Concepts

* Views - a view is a webpage that is displayed in the browser, it can include:
** Demo, lab, workshop content - typically created in asciidoc with Antora or similar
** Tabs (iframed) - internal or external HTTP-based services e.g.
*** Terminal(s) (tty) e.g. Butterfly, xtermjs etc
*** IDEs such as VSCode/CodeServer, Jupyter Notebooks etc
*** Consoles e.g. OpenShift, ArgoCD, Automation Controller etc

NOTE: Consoles are typically iframed into a view, but can be opened in a new tab/window.
Issues *may* arise with iframing some consoles, e.g. OpenShift, ArgoCD, Automation Controller etc and these are actively being investigated.


=== Requirements

* Ansible 2.9 or higher

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

=== Role Variables


A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

==== TLS / ACME

The role supports automatic TLS using Traefik's ACME integration. By default, ZeroSSL is used. You can switch to Let's Encrypt, or disable TLS entirely.

Variables (see `defaults/main.yml`):

* `showroom_tls_provider` (default: `zerossl`) — values: `letsencrypt` | `zerossl` | `none`
* `showroom_acme_email` — ACME account email (required)
* `showroom_http_port` (default: `80`) — host port for HTTP-01 (ZeroSSL only)

ZeroSSL-specific:

* `showroom_acme_zerossl_caserver` (default: `https://acme.zerossl.com/v2/DV90`)
* `showroom_acme_zerossl_eab_kid`
* `showroom_acme_zerossl_eab_hmac_key`

Example (ZeroSSL):

```
showroom_tls_provider: zerossl
showroom_acme_email: you@example.com
showroom_acme_zerossl_eab_kid: "<your-eab-kid>"
showroom_acme_zerossl_eab_hmac_key: "<your-eab-hmac>"
```

Notes:

* ZeroSSL uses HTTP-01 and requires EAB (kid/hmac) values.
* Let's Encrypt uses TLS-ALPN-01 and does not require EAB.
* Both ACME providers require inbound TCP/443 to be reachable for certificate issuance and access.
* ZeroSSL additionally requires inbound TCP/80 for the HTTP-01 challenge; Let's Encrypt (TLS-ALPN-01) does not require port 80.
* `none` disables TLS and ACME entirely. Traefik serves HTTP on `showroom_http_port` (default 80) only; port 443 is not exposed.

===== Provider behavior

Provider choice sets sane defaults; you may override via variables:

* `zerossl` → default caserver `https://acme.zerossl.com/v2/DV90`, default challenge `http`, requires EAB
* `letsencrypt` → default caserver `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`, default challenge `tlsalpn`
* `none` → disables TLS/ACME; only `web` entrypoint on port 80 is enabled

Example (HTTP-only):

```
showroom_tls_provider: none
showroom_http_port: 80
```
